 # Max Flow Algorithms
  - This repository contains the implementation and testcases for Graph theory's max flow algorithms.
  - As of now, I have created only one algorithm which is Ford Fulkerson.
  - As of now, I have implemented the max flow algorithms in C++.
  - For Contribution purpose, Read Contribution Guidline [below](#Contribution).

 # Available algorithms
  - Ford Fulkerson's Algorithm
    - Time Complexity: O(max_flow * E)
    - Space Complexity: O(V + E)

 # Contribution
  - Thank you for reading this !!
  - If you want to contribute to this repository then you can,
    - By finding any bug, you can report it and you can also make a PR to fix it or you can provide testcases on which it is failing
    - Add more testcases(graph's images are not neccesary)
    - Add more algorithms like dinic's, Edmonds-Karp's, etc...
    - Add Documentation file, which explains the algorithms
    - Add Language support other than C++.
  - Hold your breath, see rules for contribution [below](#Contribution-Rules)

 # Contribution Rules
  - You have to follow the given file format and code format.
  - For Other languages, you can create separate folder for them.
  - If possible then try to make it using Object-Oriented Approch(btw, I have mainly created this repo for this purpose only, to practise OOP of C++ üòÅüòÅ).
  - That's all. Valar Morghulis.
